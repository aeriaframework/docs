# Help Topics

This section is meant as a guide to several real-world tasks. Keep in mind Aeria's cohesive design makes several frontend behaviors be determined by backend definitions. The backend counterpart of Aeria has it's own [Help Topics](/aeria/help-topics) page and it should be used as complementary read.
