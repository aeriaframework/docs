# Aeria

Glad you made it until here! This section of the documentation will cover the backend part of Aeria, including [Aeria Lang](/aeria/aeria-lang), a DSL that ships with the framework. Switch at anytime between documentation sections by using the dropdown located at the topbar.

```aeria
collection HelloWorld {
  properties {
    newcomers_welcome const @value(true)
  }
}
```
